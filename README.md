# FileOrganizer
Automatically sweeps and organizes selected directories by moving files to dedicated folders.

This script is intended to clean a selected folder by moving all its content to dedicated categorized subfolders.
* The code will run in the background sleeping, looking for any new files in a target folder and immediately moves them to their corresponding locations as soon as you place them.
* You can add it to your start up menu and it should continue to run and organize in the background while you work.
* Make sure you specify the target folder to organize in the script.
* Most common file formats are hardcoded but make sure you account for any additional formats that are not considered in the script.
* Runs on Windows only.
